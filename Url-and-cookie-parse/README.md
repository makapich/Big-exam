This homework project contains the implementation of two parsing functions: `parse` and `parse_cookie`. The purpose of these functions is to process and extract information from input data.

The `parse_cookie` function takes in a string as input and returns information extracted from a cookie.

## Conclusion

This homework serves as a demonstration of my ability to work with GitHub and its features.
