# Django Project

This repository contains a Django homework project initialized with the latest version of Django.

## Features:

* The catalog app contains management commands to populate db with users (generated by faker) by amount and delete them by id. The amount of users created once can't be higher than 10. The superuser can't be deleted by the management command.
* The catalog app has models with different types of relations which are visualized by graph_models from django_extensions.
* The triangle app has a form with MinValueValidator.
